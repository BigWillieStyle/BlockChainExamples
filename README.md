# BlockChainExamples

CppBlockChainExample

C++ project to demonstrate blockchain cryptography transaction model.  This code uses "Proof of Work" to a create a valid transaction hash.  This is achieved by counting the number of zeros at the beginning of the hash.  If the number of zeros is equal to or greater than the difficulty level set in the code, the block is valid. Else the powNonce variable is incremented and the hash created again. This process is repeated until a hash is produced that is valid.
